      <h2>Start Quickly</h2>
      <p>Xing creates a Ruby On Rails API server and AngularJS application with a single command. A second command launches your development environment in an integrated console. Skip months of time lost to build systems, managing processes, and boilerplate code.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="simple">
      <h2>Keep It Simple</h2>
      <p>Jump headfirst into developing next-generation Single Page Applications without drowning in the deep end. Xing offers a clear path for all aspects of building an app: tools to build an API, file structure for your frontend, and a powerful client-side data library.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="future">
      <h2>Plan Ahead</h2>
      <p>Xing uses the best tools of today, plus advanced features not found anywhere else. Your entire API will be hypermedia-enabled by default, the first framework where your javascript client doesn't even need to know your API server's URLs ahead of time.</p>

     <h2>Getting Started</h2>
     <p>
       Start a new Xing app in minutes:
     </p>
     <code-tabs>
       <code-pane name="Install Xing" languages="bash">
# You'll need these installed first: ruby, npm, redis, PostgreSQL, tmux
$ gem install xing-framework
$ xing new book-app
$ cd book-app
$ rake initialize
$ rake develop
        </code-pane>
      </code-tabs>
      <p>
        These commands will download and install all the libraries required for
        a full fledged web application, set up a database to develop against,
        and create the basic files you'll need to get started. Finally, it'll
        start up a development environment, complete with servers for both the
        front end assets and the back-end API. You'll be ready to start adding
        features right away.

    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <p>
     Xing apps start by defining hypermedia resources for your API server through "serializers" and "mappers", then building a user interface to interact with them in Angular.

    <h2>Can I use Xing in a Production Environment?</h2>
    <p>Xing is still in beta, but the creators of Xing have used it in production applications for over a year. Xing will hit a 1.0 release around March of 2016, once the open source community gives feedback and critical bugs are addressed. After that, Xing will retain backwards compatibility for all releases in the 1.x series. Some additional features planned for Xing include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improvements to onboarding and ease of use for new users</li>
      <li>Code generation and scaffolding of common resource patterns</li>
      <li>A full featured CMS module that plugs into Xing </li>
      <li>Better integration testing capabilities</li>
      <li>Ability to add a mobile app using Ionic/Cordova</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Xing will eventually support AngularJS 2.x, and the version that supports Angular 2 will be the first release in the Xing 2.x series. The Angular 2 compatible Xing aims to release when the final version of Angular 2 releases. However, Xing's 1.x series will retain support as long as Google supports Angular 1.x.</p>
