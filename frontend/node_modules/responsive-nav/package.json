It uses touch events and CSS3 transitions for the best possible performance. It also contains a “clever” workaround that makes it possible to transition from `height: 0` to `height: auto`, which isn’t normally possible with CSS3 transitions.\n\n\n#### Features:\n\n* Simple, semantic markup.\n* Weighs only 1.3kb minified and Gzip’ed.\n* Doesn’t require any external library.\n* Uses CSS3 transitions and touch events.\n* Supports RequireJS and multiple instances.\n* Removes the 300ms delay between a physical tap and the click event.\n* Makes it possible to use CSS3 transitions with height: auto.\n* Built with accessibility in mind, meaning that everything works on screen readers and with JavaScript disabled, too.\n* Works in all major desktop and mobile browsers, including IE 6 and up.\n* Free to use under the MIT license.\n\n\n# Demos\n\n* [Fixed positioned one page demo](http://www.adtile.me/fixed-nav/) using smooth scrolling. View source on GitHub: [adtile/fixed-nav](https://github.com/adtile/fixed-nav)\n* [Advanced demo](http://responsive-nav.com/demo/) (View the [source code](https://github.com/viljamis/responsive-nav.js/tree/master/demos/advanced-left-navigation))\n* [Official website](http://responsive-nav.com) (works as a demo, too!)\n* [Simple demo with IE support](http://responsive-nav.com/demo-respondjs/) (View the [source code](https://github.com/viljamis/responsive-nav.js/tree/master/demos/ie-support-using-respondjs))\n* 11(!) additional examples included in this repository's [demos](https://github.com/viljamis/responsive-nav.js/tree/master/demos) folder.\n\n\n# Usage instructions\n\nFollowing the steps below you will be able to get the plugin up and running. If you notice any bugs, please post them to [GitHub issues](https://github.com/viljamis/responsive-nav.js/issues).\n\n1. Link files:\n\t```html\n\t\t<!-- Put these into the <head> -->\n\t\t<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"responsive-nav.css\">\n\t\t<script src=\"responsive-nav.js\"></script>\n\t```\n\n1. Add markup:\n\t```html\n\t\t<nav class=\"nav-collapse\">\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"#\">Home</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"#\">About</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"#\">Projects</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"#\">Contact</a></li>\n\t\t \t</ul>\n\t\t</nav>\n\t```\n\n1. Hook up the plugin:\n\t```html\n\t<!-- Put this right before the </body> closing tag -->\n\t\t<script>\n\t\t\tvar nav = responsiveNav(\".nav-collapse\");\n\t\t</script>\n\t```\n\n1. Customizable options:\n\t```javascript\n\t\tvar nav = responsiveNav(\".nav-collapse\", { // Selector\n\t\t\tanimate: true, // Boolean: Use CSS3 transitions, true or false\n\t\t\ttransition: 284, // Integer: Speed of the transition, in milliseconds\n\t\t\tlabel: \"Menu\", // String: Label for the navigation toggle\n\t\t\tinsert: \"before\", // String: Insert the toggle before or after the navigation\n\t\t\tcustomToggle: \"\", // Selector: Specify the ID of a custom toggle\n\t\t\tcloseOnNavClick: false, // Boolean: Close the navigation when one of the links are clicked\n\t\t\topenPos: \"relative\", // String: Position of the opened nav, relative or static\n\t\t\tnavClass: \"nav-collapse\", // String: Default CSS class. If changed, you need to edit the CSS too!\n\t\t\tnavActiveClass: \"js-nav-active\", // String: Class that is added to <html> element when nav is active\n\t\t\tjsClass: \"js\", // String: 'JS enabled' class which is added to <html> element\n\t\t\tinit: function(){}, // Function: Init callback\n\t\t\topen: function(){}, // Function: Open callback\n\t\t\tclose: function(){} // Function: Close callback\n\t\t});\n\t```\n\n\n# Public methods\n\nSee the [example code here](https://github.com/viljamis/responsive-nav.js/blob/master/demos/public-events/index.html) for the usage.\n\n`nav.toggle();`\n\n`nav.open();`\n\n`nav.close();`\n\n`nav.destroy();`\n\n`nav.resize();`\n\n\n# Changing the breakpoint\n\nBreakpoint is defined in the [responsive-nav.css](https://github.com/viljamis/responsive-nav.js/blob/master/responsive-nav.css) file. Responsive Nav checks on window resize and on orientation change if the navigation toggle has `display: none;` and based on that switches between mobile and desktop states.\n\n\n# Supporting old IEs\n\nEven though Responsive Nav works even on IE6, you should remember that IE8 and under do not support media queries and thus can’t change between \"small screen\" and \"large screen\" styles. If needed, you can add Media Query support for those browsers using [respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond). There’s an example [here](https://github.com/viljamis/responsive-nav.js/tree/master/demos/ie-support-using-respondjs).\n\nWhen old IE support is needed you should stick to using ID selector with Responsive Nav. That’s because the plugin uses `getElementById` method by default which is widely supported in all browsers. When using classes or element selectors `querySelector` will be used instead which isn’t supported in old IEs.\n\n\n# Things to keep in mind\n\nCalculated Max-height doesn't account for top/bottom padding on `.nav-collapse` (this is on purpose). If you need to add padding inside the nav, you can apply it to any other element, for example the `<ul>` inside `.nav-collapse`.\n\n\n# Tested on the following platforms\n\n* iOS 4.2.1+\n* Android 1.6+\n* Windows Phone 7.5+\n* Blackberry 7.0+\n* Blackberry Tablet 2.0+\n* Jolla 1.0+\n* Kindle 3.3+\n* Maemo 5.0+\n* Meego 1.2+\n* Symbian 3\n* Symbian Belle\n* Symbian S40 Asha\n* webOS 2.0+\n* Windows XP+\n* Mac OS X\n\n\n# Working on the repository\n\n[GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/) is used for the build process, which means node and npm are required. If you already have those on your machine, you can install Grunt and all dependencies required for the build using:\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g grunt-cli\nnpm install\n```\n\n\n## Starting the server\n\n```sh\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000\n```\n\n\n## Git Hooks\n\nIt is useful to setup a pre-commit and post-checkout hooks to smooth your workflow. On pre-commit we want to ensure that the project can build successfully, and on post-checkout we want to ensure that any new dependencies are installed via npm.\n\n\n### Pre-Commit\n\n```sh\ntouch .git/hooks/pre-commit && echo -e '#!/bin/sh\\ngrunt test' > .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit\n```\n\n\n### Post-Checkout\n\n```sh\ntouch .git/hooks/post-checkout && echo -e '#!/bin/sh\\nnpm install\\nexit 0' > .git/hooks/post-checkout && chmod +x .git/hooks/post-checkout\n```\n\n## Building The Project\n\nTo build the project, run unit tests etc. enter the following at the terminal:\n\n```sh\ngrunt\n```\n\nGrunt can also be used to monitor files and re-build the project on each change. For this we use Grunt's watch task:\n\n```sh\ngrunt watch\n```\n\nNext time you change the file, Grunt will perform all build tasks.\n\n\n## Testing\n\nThe test suite can be run with `grunt test` and is also part of the default Grunt task. This command runs all tests locally using PhantomJS.\n\n### Running on multiple devices/browsers\n\nIt's possible to run the test suite on multiple devices with Karma.\n\nThe Karma server can be started with `grunt karma` and multiple browsers should then point to the machine running the server on port 9876 (e.g. http://localhost:9876). Once the browsers are connected, the test suite can be run with `grunt karma:all:run`.\n\nAn easier way to test on multiple devices as part of the development cycle is to use karma with the watch task. Running `grunt karma watch` will automatically start the Karma server in the background and will run the tests automatically every time a file changes, on every connected device.\n\n\n# Special thanks\n\nIn random order:\n\n* [Matteo Spinelli](https://twitter.com/cubiq)\n* [Matt Stow](https://twitter.com/stowball)\n* [Joao Carlos](https://twitter.com/jcxplorer)\n* [Vesa Vänskä](https://twitter.com/vesan)\n* [Andrea Carraro](https://github.com/toomuchdesign)\n* [Nick Williams](https://twitter.com/WickyNilliams)\n\n\n# License\n\nLicensed under the MIT license.\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Viljami Salminen, http://viljamis.com/\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Fixes a bug which caused the navigation to sometimes not toggle.  Also fixes a bug in Safari that sometimes caused the navigation render incorrectly when switching between browser tabs. (+Adds more comments to the code.)\n\n`1.0.32` (2014-03-05) - Ditching the `[].forEach.call(NodeList)` hack to make the code more sensible and future-proof.\n\n`1.0.31` (2014-03-02) - Fixes Chrome Mobile rendering issue.\n\n`1.0.30` (2014-03-02) - Better performance. New [fixed navigation example](https://github.com/adtile/fixed-nav) provided by [Adtile](https://twitter.com/adtilehq). This release fixes an issue where multiple navigations on the same page got the same calculated height. Toggle now has an \"active\" class when the nav is open. Two new options are added: \"closeOnNavClick\" and \"navActiveClass\". Two new methods are also added: \"open\" and \"close\" (thanks to [@munkius](https://github.com/munkius) for the heads up on this!). This release adds also better \"hamburger\" icon for advanced demos which you can now style via css (size, color, shadow & etc). Includes also other bug fixes targeting older Android devices.\n\n`1.0.25` (2013-12-13) - Fixes ghost click issues on Android + a problem where calculated max-height might get overridden under certain circumstances.\n\n`1.0.24` (2013-11-27) - Adds new option called \"navClass.\" All tests should also work now on real iOS, Windows Phone and Android devices (when using grunt-karma), and not just with PhantomJS.\n\n`1.0.23` (2013-09-25) - Fixes IE8 bugs + starts using automated builds and tests.\n\n`1.0.22` (2013-09-19) - Public resize method (to allow calling resize manually when needed).\n\n`1.0.21` (2013-09-18) - Multiple instances are now possible thanks to [@toomuchdesign](https://github.com/toomuchdesign). Uses classes instead of ID's now by default, but can be configured to use ID's if old IE support is needed (check the \"ie-support\" folder in demos).\n\n`1.0.20` (2013-08-12) - Uses now touchmove & touchend, which means that the menu doesn’t trigger anymore if the user starts moving finger instead of just tapping. Also fixes one Android bug and a bug which appeared when tapping the toggle really fast over and over. Plugin’s Functionality doesn’t depent on window load event anymore so it works now with tools like require.js too.\n\n`1.0.16` (2013-08-02) - Set `navOpen` state in the `_init` method. Thanks [@nicolashery](https://github.com/nicolashery)!\n\n`1.0.15` (2013-06-28) - Responsive Nav now automatically combines multiple navigations inside a container.\n\n`1.0.14` (2013-04-13) - Adds touchend listener and stopProganation + prevents ghost click from happening on some Android browsers. \"tabIndex\" and \"debug\" settings are being removed.\n\n`v1.11` (2013-04-09) - Performance optimization, bug fixes and 6 additional usage examples\n\n`v1.07` (2013-04-03) - Simplifies the codebase and fixes few bugs\n\n`v1.05` (2013-03-31) - Adds callback functionality and removes unnecessary CSS.\n\n`v1.03` (2013-03-28) - Adds option to disable CSS3 transitions + three other options called \"tabIndex\", \"openPos\" and \"jsClass\".\n\n`v1.00` (2013-03-25) - Release.
